/**
  * A barrel-threaded multithreaded 2-read, 1-write register file implemented using SyncReadMem.
  *
  * In this design, a single thread ID (provided via `threadID`) is concatenated with the register index
  * for all read and write ports. The SRAM is implemented as a flat array with a depth of (threads * depth).
  * Each thread has its own independent register space.
  *
  * Ports:
  *   - threadID: The current thread identifier (applied to all accesses).
  *   - src1: Read port 1 register index.
  *   - src1data: Read port 1 output.
  *   - src2: Read port 2 register index.
  *   - src2data: Read port 2 output.
  *   - dst1: Write port register index.
  *   - dst1data: Data to be written.
  *   - wen: Write enable.
  *
  * The effective address is computed by concatenating the threadID (upper bits) with the register index.
  * The synchronous memory read is delayed one cycle and then registered via RegNext to align with the pipeline.
