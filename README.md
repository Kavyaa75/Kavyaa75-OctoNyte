A RISC-V Multithreaded Core Targeting the Skywater 0.13um ASIC library

#Use Case

### **Use Case 1: Synthesizing RTL to Meet Timing Constraints**
#### Goal:
Ensure that the RTL generated from Chisel meets the specified clock period for the processor.

#### Steps:
1. Import the Chisel-generated Verilog code into the synthesis tool.
2. Define timing constraints (e.g., 1ns clock period for a 1GHz processor).
3. Perform synthesis and generate timing reports.
4. Analyze paths violating the timing constraints and identify critical paths.
5. Optimize the design by adjusting pipeline stages or re-synthesizing with improved constraints.

#### Example:
- Input:
  - RTL design for a 4-issue RISC-V processor.
  - Timing constraints: Clock period = 1ns.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Synthesis produces a design meeting the 1GHz clock requirement.

#### Importance:
Ensures the design can operate at the desired clock speed without timing violations.

### **Use Case 2: Technology Mapping for Target Process**
#### Goal:
Translate the RTL design into gate-level logic using a specific technology library, such as SkyWater 130nm.

#### Steps:
1. Load the target process library (e.g., SkyWater 130nm PDK).
2. Perform technology mapping to replace generic RTL with library-specific gates.
3. Generate a synthesized netlist with gates and flip-flops from the technology library.
4. Validate the area and power consumption of the design.

#### Example:
- Input:
  - RTL design and `sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib`.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A synthesized netlist optimized for the SkyWater 130nm process.

#### Importance:
Adapts the design for manufacturing on the target process node.

### **Use Case 3: Optimizing Power and Area**
#### Goal:
Minimize power consumption and chip area while meeting timing constraints.

#### Steps:
1. Use synthesis tools to perform area and power analysis after initial synthesis.
2. Apply optimization techniques like gate collapsing, logic restructuring, or clock gating.
3. Re-synthesize the design and compare the power and area metrics.

#### Example:
- Input:
  - RTL design with initial synthesis area of 5mm² and power of 300mW.
- Expected Outcome:
  - Optimized design with reduced area (e.g., 4.5mm²) and power (e.g., 250mW).

#### Importance:
Reduces manufacturing costs and extends battery life for portable applications.
